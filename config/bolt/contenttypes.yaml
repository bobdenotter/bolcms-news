# Pages can be used for the more 'static' pages on your site. This content-type
# has a 'templateselect' field, which allows you to override the record_template
# setting for an individual page.
# The taxonomy for this ContentType is defined as 'groups', which is a so-called
# "grouping taxonomy". This way you can easily group sets of pages that logically
# belong together. If your site has a 'services' section, in which you'd like to
# list the different types of services a company provides, you can group these
# together.
